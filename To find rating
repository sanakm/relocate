most of my work for the site was backend and database entry.   there was no relevent API, 
so we had to accumulate the data and base our city ratings on our own findings.  to do so
we did the following: 

1) found the country/city happiness rating, based on The World Happiness Report 
published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. 

2) found the individual city's safety rating
  - safest place from our selected cities is Zurich, Switzerland, followed by 
    Copenhagen, Denmark, and Vienna, Austria
  - most dangerous place is Brasilia, Brasil.
  - Toronto is the top ranking city outside of the ultra-safe city rankings, ie. the
    best of the average cities.

3) found the average incomes for profession in our selected cities, given experience 
   levels and education
  - default for the site, for the purpose of this presentation is currently set to 
    0 years of experience holding a holding a Non-Degree Certificate Program.
  - given more time, we would implement the option to specify qualifications.
  - we then compared the incomes to the Toronto average, and generated a percentage 
    difference to use in our algorithm.
  
4) found cost of living for the different cities.
  - again, compared the cost of living with Toronto, and generated a percentage difference
    between the two.
    
5) determined the need for the profession, calling it the 'profession shortage' ranking.
  - hardest part of the research, as we had to go off of classified postings and other
    random info from miscellaneous sites.

6)  added all the numbers together to determine each city's rank for each profession.
