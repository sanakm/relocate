most of my work for the site was backend and database entry.   

we had to accumulate the majority of our data and base our city ratings on our own 
findings.

so first we found each city's happiness rating, based on The World Happiness Report 
published by the United Nations 

next we gathered each city's safety rating ...
  - out of our selected cities, the safest place is Zurich, Switzerland 
  - most dangerous place is Brasilia in Brasil.
  - Toronto is the safest of the averagely safe cities

then we found the average incomes for each profession in our selected cities, given 
  experience and levels and education
  
then we found the cost of living for the different cities and computed them against the 
city's average income for each profession, to generate a income to cost of living rating 
    
then we determined the need for each profession in each city, which was based on 
    classified postings and other random info from miscellaneous sites
  
and lastely we computed each cities overall rating based on these individual ratings 
and numbers.
