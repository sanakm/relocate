To Do:


1) Add general information and purpose of site, then add 'info' link/page to splash:
    'reLocate is a database that rates the cities of the world according to your current
    position in life, in order to assist with your relocation.  The rating is based on 
    several factors, including the city's demand for your profession, the city's average 
    income for your profession given your experience, the city's cost of living and 
    current exchange rate, the country's accessibility, your marital status, 
    whether or not you have kids, and the city's compatability with your hobbies 
    and lifestyle.   Given the time restraint, our database and rating system currently
    assumes that you have 0 years experience in your profession holding a Non-Degree
    Certificate Program, are not married, have no kids, and that you pursue an active 
    lifestyle common to a mid-20s career oriented individual.'

2) Add 'cost_of_living' column to cities, and adjust webdev_rating accordingly

3) Add automated explanation for profession rating of city.  
    ie. "<div><p>" + selected_city.country + " has a happines rating of " + selected_city.happiness_rating + " and " + selected_city.name + " has a family safety rating of " + selected_city.family_safety_rating + ".  " + selected_city.name + " has a cost of living rating of " + selected_city.cost_of_living + ", which, together with the city's shortage rating for your profession (" + web_dev_shortage + "), and the city's average income of " + selected_city.webdev_average_salary + ", generates the city's rating of </p><p id='big_number'>" + webdev_rating + ".</p></div>"

3) Add Journalist info and add vancouver/silcone valley info
